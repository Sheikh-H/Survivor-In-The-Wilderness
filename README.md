# Survivor-In-The-Woods
"A python text-based game developed during my course at Code Nation"

The game was built on Visual Studio Code with the Python programming language.
We were a strong team of 4 individuals who all had a very good idea of what the computing world is.

The project target was to make a text-based game on python that would have the genre of an RPG Adventure Game.

With our heads together, we were able to cultivate the idea of creating a game that's based on a survival situation with the main character being the only character in the game... or maybe.

We wanted to create the impulse of having more to the game before and after which would allow room for the storylines cliff hanger.

We wanted other developers/students who would look at this project and see how they could improve on it and then go build it in. 

This way the game remained within it's RPG theme while also having the storyline thats based on adventures. 

In this repository, I have taken the time to upload all project documentations from what was submitted as the group presentation to the code itself for you to review and play around with. 

With in the code you will find comments all over to ensure a detailed description of what each line of coding is doing, that way anybody who is either new to the platform or new to coding in Python can replicate our code to develop their own.
